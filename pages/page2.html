                "Sugar" was released as the band's first ever single on May 24, 1998, and as an EP on May 26, 1999. The song was taken from their debut studio album, System of a Down (1998).
                "Sugar" has been described as "a spazzy, jazz-spattered noise rock freak-out". The song features rapped verses from lead singer Serj Tankian, along with death metal growls and shrieks, the latter two being signatures of the band's early sound. The verses of the song feature guitarist Daron Malakian on backing vocals. Later in the band's career, he would move on to be more of a co-lead vocalist (although he sang on demos of "Roulette" and DAM"). The ending of the song features the band speeding up from the original tempo.

                    "Spiders" was released on February 10, 1999.
                    "Spiders", like many of System of a Down's songs, is written in the key of C minor. The song relies heavily on the Cm, B♭, and E♭ chords, as well as Fm, Gm, A♭, B, and D♭. "Spiders" uses 4/4 time at a slow tempo, and employs drum-rolls and syncopation in the verses. The music can be described as haunting, ominous, dark, frightening, and depressing with its dark melody and echoing vocal overdubs. Serj Tankian's vocals, while low and melodic in the verses, become more energetic and dissonant in the refrains.

                    "Chop Suey!" was released on August 13, 2001, as the first single from their second album, Toxicity (2001). The single earned the band its first Grammy nomination in 2002 for Best Metal Performance. "Chop Suey!" is often considered the band's signature song.
                    In an interview, Daron Malakian explained, "The song is about how we are regarded differently depending on how we pass. Everyone deserves to die. Like, if I were now to die from drug abuse, they might say I deserved it because I abused dangerous drugs. Hence the line, 'I cry when angels deserve to die.'" The lyrics for the midsection ("Father into your hands I commend my spirit" ...) were randomly picked out by Serj Tankian from Rick Rubin's book collection after Tankian was struggling for ideas. Although it was not revealed what book the lines were taken from, they are quoted from the sayings of Jesus on the cross (Luke 23:46 and Mark 15:34).

                    "Toxicity" is a single by American heavy metal band System of a Down, released in 2002. It was originally released on the album of the same name. The writing credits for the song are Malakian, Odadjian, Tankian and Dolmayan. It is known for its dynamic chorus, aggressive vocals, and prominent drum beat.
                    The song is predominantly in triple meter, alternating between 6/4, 12/8 and 4/4 time. The guitar during the verse plays in 6/4 using a 2+2+2 phrasing while the heavy part ("somewhere between the sacred silence and sleep") makes use of a hemiola with the guitar switching to a 3+3+3+3 pattern while the drums remain in compound duple meter until the bridge. The song was ranked number 14 on VH1's 40 Greatest Metal Songs, and was called a nu metal classic by Stylus Magazine.
